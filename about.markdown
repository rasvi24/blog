I am (Mohamed Rasvi) principal software engineer at Alpha Cloud Labs. I architect and develop applications on different technologies. Some of my favourites are AWS, Serverless, Kubernetes, Jakarta EE, Spring Boot, Python and Vert.x.

I have experience in developing some of the industry leading real time application with fault tolerant architectures. I am specialized in making servers highly available in a cost effective manner. Often I develop the application and find myself writing code end to end including the front-end.
